        <p>If they made a hybrid of guinea pigs and cats, what would it be like? They would be called <b style="color:green;">Guinea Cats</b style="color:blue;">, and I think it would be awesome! They would definitely be the cutest animals around, and everyone would have to have one. It would be illegal to not own one! But no one would ever break that law anyway, so it would just be another weird law on the books that your average person would never know about.</p>
